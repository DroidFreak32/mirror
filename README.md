# NOTICE
My mirror is currently down!  
This was all hosted on Oracle Cloud Free Tier and like all good things that are free, it did not last forever! :(

I am working on building my own NAS where I will be self-hosting again, but that will take time as I am planning to update this repo after building my NAS with all the additional setups like:

- Traefik Reverse proxy
- [Perfect Home Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com/) setup
- Proxmox on Debian
- Networking & Firewall configs
- VPN Setup (Tailscale  & Wireguard)

Also since it will be hosted at my home server and not on a Public Cloud instance, I unfortunately will be under CGNAT IPv4 so my new mirror will be IPv6 ONLY!
